# Work samples

Sanitized examples of systems/infrastructure operations work: documentation structure, incident runbooks, PowerShell health automation, escalation writing, and case studies.

All content is fictionalized or generalized. No customer data, credentials, internal host names, production IPs, or proprietary logs.

## What this shows

- **Documentation discipline** — structure that a regional desk or the next technician can use without a handoff call
- **Method-first troubleshooting** — isolate guest vs host vs DNS vs site before changing anything
- **Operational automation** — scheduled health checks that log exceptions instead of hoping someone notices
- **Clear communication** — escalation summaries and customer-facing updates written for action, not theater

## Samples

### Operations / MSP-oriented (2026)

| [`samples/invoke-windows-healthcheck.ps1`](samples/invoke-windows-healthcheck.ps1) | Scheduled Windows / Hyper-V health check (disk, services, VM state, optional cluster, JSON log, optional email) |

### Support, escalation, and case studies

## How to read the Hyper-V pair

1. **IT Glue structure** — where the runbook and host Configuration would live
2. **SOP-LPG-004** — human path after an alert
3. **`Invoke-WindowsHealthCheck.ps1`** — detector that can feed the ticket/RMM picture

The script uses built-in Windows / Hyper-V / FailoverClusters cmdlets only. It is a sample, not production tooling. Review before any use.
